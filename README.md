### Welcome to Metal Gear: Pong!

This is a 2D game made from the original pong (1972), for 2 players locally on the same keyboard.
Use E/D keys to move left player and O/L keys to move right player. A bonus mode is availaible including powerups and other features aswell as music and sounds.

The game has been built from scratch using canvas from HTML5. This project is my part of a group project called ft_transcendence.
I have imported my game code and made a simple website to host it here.

The main title logo (modified by myself with GIMP), the FOX logo, the sounds and the music are property of Konami.
All the others materials, including UI symbols, bandana, health bars and ration icon are made by myself from scratch.
